I'm into C#, SQL Server, .NET Core, Blazor, and Azure. I love relational data access, [Dapper](https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper), and I make a couple Dapper extension libraries:
- [Dapper.CX](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Dapper.CX), a CRUD library
- [Dapper.QX](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Dapper.QX), for making inline SQL better and testable
- [Models](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Models), some low-level model class stuff I use everywhere

Along with some SQL Server-related libraries and tools:
- [SqlServerUtil](https://github.com/adamfoneil/SqlServerUtil) bulk insert, deep copy, and view materializing utilities for SQL Server
- [ModelSync](https://github.com/adamfoneil/ModelSync), a SQL schema diff library that can treat .NET assemblies as data sources. Powers my [ModelSync App](https://github.com/adamfoneil/ModelSync.WinForms)
- [Zinger](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Postulate.Zinger), a SQL client sort of like SSMS specifically for C# productivity. Check out its [Data Migrator](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Postulate.Zinger/wiki/Data-Migrator) feature.
- [SqlServer.LocalDb](https://github.com/adamfoneil/SqlServer.LocalDb), an integration testing library for SQL Server 
- [Excel2SqlServer](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Excel2SqlServer.Library), an Excel import library
- [DbCache](https://github.com/adamfoneil/DbCache) for throttling API calls to 3rd party services

I like helping developers who are stuck. I have a deep background in SQL Server, C#, WinForms, MVC, and .NET Core. If you think I can help with something, please [reach out](mailto:adamosoftware@gmail.com).

I'm also getting into Blazor, but much of my work here is closed source. However I am working on a general-purpose show-and-tell project [BlazorAO](https://github.com/adamfoneil/BlazorAO).

I have some closed-source products:
- [Sendhook.net](https://sendhookapp.azurewebsites.net/) for capturing inbound email as HTTP posts at your own endpoints, uses Azure functions, queues, and blob storage
- [SqlChartify](https://sqlchartify.azurewebsites.net/) for writing queries and getting charts made with [ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/).

Some other odds and ends:
- [AOLicensing](https://github.com/adamfoneil/AOLicensing) for desktop app gatekeeping and licensing
- [RoslynMarkdowner](https://github.com/adamfoneil/RoslynMarkdowner), a utility for generating C# documentation as markdown. I use this whenever I want to provide a reference of methods and parameters for my libraries.
- [AzDeploy](https://github.com/adamfoneil/AzDeploy), my continuous deployment mechanism for WinForms apps
- In [ChunkUpload](https://github.com/adamfoneil/ChunkUpload), I sketched out an approach to supporting large file uploads. A NuGet [package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AO.AzureUploader) came out of this that I'm using in other projects now.
- [CloudObjects](https://github.com/adamfoneil/CloudObjects) is a REST API project in .NET Core

WinForms stuff:
- [JsonSettings](https://github.com/adamfoneil/JsonSettings), for strong-typed json-based configuration, mainly in WinForms apps, with DPAPI encryption
- [SourceFolderCleanup](https://github.com/adamfoneil/SourceFolderCleanup) another WinForms app I use personally
- [CredManager2](https://github.com/adamfoneil/CredManager2), a password manager I use myself, because it's fun to make stuff like this
- [WinForms.Library](https://github.com/adamfoneil/WinForms.Library), data binding helpers for WinForms. I never made the transition to XAML/WPF, sorry
