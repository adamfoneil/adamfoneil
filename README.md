I'm into C#, SQL Server, .NET Core, Blazor, and Azure. I love relational data access, [Dapper](https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper), and I make a couple Dapper extension libraries:
- [Dapper.CX](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Dapper.CX), a CRUD library
- [Dapper.QX](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Dapper.QX), for making inline SQL better and testable
- [SqlServerUtil](https://github.com/adamfoneil/SqlServerUtil) bulk insert, deep copy, and view materializing utilities for SQL Server
- [ModelSync](https://github.com/adamfoneil/ModelSync), a SQL schema diff library that can treat .NET assemblies as data sources

I like helping developers who are stuck. I have a deep background in SQL Server, C#, WinForms, MVC, and .NET Core. If you think I can help with something, please [reach out](mailto:adamosoftware@gmail.com).

- [CloudObjects](https://github.com/adamfoneil/CloudObjects) is a REST API project in .NET Core I've been working on lately. This leads to related side projects like [DbCache](https://github.com/adamfoneil/DbCache) for throttling API calls to 3rd party services.
- I love serverless code, and I create utilities for Azure Functions: [PayPalHelper](https://github.com/adamfoneil/PayPalHelper2), [CloudLicensing](https://github.com/adamfoneil/CloudLicensing). Much of my work in this area is closed source, but I can share my custom library [Excel2SqlServer](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Excel2SqlServer.Library) for importing Excel spreadsheets into SQL Server, which I use with Azure Functions.
- I love blob storage. Most of the stuff I do in this area is closed source, but I can share my homegrown continous deployment solution for WinForms apps [AzDeploy](https://github.com/adamfoneil/AzDeploy), which uses blob storage.
- I'm very familiar with Azure App Service, and have deployed and managed several web apps, notably [Ginseng8](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Ginseng8), although this project fizzled. I chase after lot of big ideas, many of which go nowhere. I'm very proud of [HistoricProperties.com](https://www.historicproperties.com/), an MVC app I did for my high school Latin teacher. This involved me hiring and collaborating with a front-end specialist who made the app look great.
- I'm very familiar with Azure SQL Database, which grew out of my on-premises SQL Server background. I have a lot of experience with database design and performance troubleshooting.
- I still work a lot with WinForms, and have a SQL client meant for C#-specific integration called [Zinger](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Postulate.Zinger). This is a companion tool of sorts for my [Dapper.QX](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Dapper.QX) library.

I have some closed-source products:
- [Sendhook.net](https://sendhookapp.azurewebsites.net/) for capturing inbound email as HTTP posts at your own endpoints
- [SqlChartify](https://sqlchartify.azurewebsites.net/) for writing queries and getting charts made with [ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/).
- [ModelSync](https://aosoftware.net/modelsync/), an EF migration alternative. (Subtext: I don't care for Entity Framework.) The library that powers this is open source [here](https://github.com/adamfoneil/ModelSync).

When coworkers get stuck, I like to help with demo projects to sketch out possible solutions and to get the benefit of a clean slate:
- In [ChunkUpload](https://github.com/adamfoneil/ChunkUpload) for example, I sketched out an approach to supporting large file uploads. A NuGet [package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AO.AzureUploader) came out of this that I'm using in other projects now!
- In [NotifyDemo](https://github.com/adamfoneil/NotifyDemo) for example, I tried to implement a SignalR demo. But I get stuck too! I have no problem hiring people to fill in gaps in my knowledge.
- In [ParseAndViewNative](https://github.com/adamfoneil/ParseViewAndNative) we had a little algorithm challenge to consider [different ways to handle rules](https://github.com/adamfoneil/ParseViewAndNative/blob/master/ParseViewAndNative/Solutions.cs) around how our AerieHub product prioritizes file extensions when given a list. We were able to compare solutions with [tests](https://github.com/adamfoneil/ParseViewAndNative/blob/master/ParseViewAndNative.Tests/FileExtParsing.cs).

I work on many other odds and ends:
- I'm learning Blazor, and have a [demo project](https://github.com/adamfoneil/BlazorServerDemo) I'm working on intermittently. I really like what Blazor's about. (Subtext: I don't like JavaScript.)
- [RoslynMarkdowner](https://github.com/adamfoneil/RoslynMarkdowner), a utility for generating C# documentation
- [WinForms.Library](https://github.com/adamfoneil/WinForms.Library), data binding helpers for WinForms. I never made the transition to XAML/WPF, sorry
- [JsonSettings](https://github.com/adamfoneil/JsonSettings), for strong-typed json-based configuration, mainly in WinForms apps, with DPAPI encryption
- [SqlServer.LocalDb](https://github.com/adamfoneil/SqlServer.LocalDb), an integration testing library for SQL Server
- [SourceFolderCleanup](https://github.com/adamfoneil/SourceFolderCleanup) another WinForms app I use personally
- [CredManager2](https://github.com/adamfoneil/CredManager2), a password manager I use myself, because it's fun to make stuff like this
