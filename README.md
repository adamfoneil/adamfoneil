I'm into C#, SQL Server, modern .NET, Blazor, Razor, DigitalOcean, and Azure. I love relational data access, EF Core, [Dapper](https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper), and I make a couple Dapper extension libraries:
- [Dapper.Entities](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Dapper.Entities), my latest repository-based library for Dapper
- [Dapper.QX](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Dapper.QX), for making inline SQL better and testable

I work with Blazor a lot. Most of my work is closed-source, but I have a couple things in progress that are public:
- [Blazor Server Template](https://github.com/adamfoneil/BlazorServerTemplate)
- [PayPalComponenets.RCL](https://github.com/adamfoneil/PayPalComponents.RCL) is a miniature PayPal IPN testing dashboard with a [Pay Now button](https://github.com/adamfoneil/PayPalComponents.RCL/blob/master/PayPalComponents.RCL/Components/PayNowButton.razor) component.
- [UserVoice.RCL](https://github.com/adamfoneil/UserVoice.RCL) is a user feedback and acceptance test portal.

I have some closed-source products:
- [SqlChartify](https://sqlchartify.azurewebsites.net/) for writing queries and getting charts made with [ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/).

WinForms stuff:
- [ImgCloudPaste](https://github.com/adamfoneil/ImgCloudPaste), for pasting images and getting screenshot URLs using Azure storage
