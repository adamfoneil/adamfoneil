I'm into C#, SQL Server, and .NET Core. I love data access, Dapper, and I make a couple Dapper extension libraries:
- [Dapper.CX](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Dapper.CX), a CRUD library
- [Dapper.QX](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Dapper.QX), for making inline SQL better and testable
- [SqlServerUtil](https://github.com/adamfoneil/SqlServerUtil) bulk insert, deep copy, and view materializing utilities for SQL Server

I have some closed-source products:
- [SqlChartify](https://sqlchartify.azurewebsites.net/) for writing queries and getting charts made with [ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/).
- [ModelSync](http://www.aosoftware.net/modelSync.html), an EF migration alterntive.

I work on many other odds and ends:
- I'm learning Blazor, and have a [demo project](https://github.com/adamfoneil/BlazorServerDemo) I'm working on intermittently. I really like what Blazor's about. (Subtext: I don't like JavaScript.)
- A utility for generating C# documentation [RoslynMarkdowner](https://github.com/adamfoneil/RoslynMarkdowner)
- [WinForms.Library](https://github.com/adamfoneil/WinForms.Library), data binding helpers for WinForms. I never made the transition to XAML/WPF
- [JsonSettings](https://github.com/adamfoneil/JsonSettings), for strong-typed json-based configuration, mainly in WinForms apps, with DPAPI encryption
- [ModelSync](https://github.com/adamfoneil/ModelSync), the library behind my ModelSync desktop app is open source
- [SqlServer.LocalDb](https://github.com/adamfoneil/SqlServer.LocalDb), an integration testing library for SQL Server
