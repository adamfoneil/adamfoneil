I'm into C#, SQL Server, modern .NET, Blazor, Razor, DigitalOcean, and Azure. I love relational data access, EF Core, [Dapper](https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper), and I make a couple Dapper extension libraries:
- [Dapper.Entities](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Dapper.Entities), my latest repository-based library for Dapper
- [Dapper.QX](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Dapper.QX), for making inline SQL better and testable

I work with Blazor a lot. Most of my work is closed-source, but I have a couple things in progress that are public:
- [BlazorTemplate](https://github.com/adamfoneil/BlazorTemplate) provides a realistic WASM app template
- [ApiAuthDemo](https://github.com/adamfoneil/ApiAuthDemo) demonstrates a Blazor WASM app using APIs that require authorization
- [PayPalComponenets.RCL](https://github.com/adamfoneil/PayPalComponents.RCL) is a miniature PayPal IPN testing dashboard with a [Pay Now button](https://github.com/adamfoneil/PayPalComponents.RCL/blob/master/PayPalComponents.RCL/Components/PayNowButton.razor) component.
- [UserVoice.RCL](https://github.com/adamfoneil/UserVoice.RCL) is a user feedback and acceptance test portal.
- [GitHubIssues.RCL](https://github.com/adamfoneil/GitHubIssues.RCL) lets users see your GitHub Issues within your application. Also its [standalone GitHub client](https://github.com/adamfoneil/GitHubIssues.RCL/tree/master/GitHubApiClient)

I have some closed-source products:
- [Sendhook.net](https://sendhookapp.azurewebsites.net/) for capturing inbound email as HTTP posts at your own endpoints, uses Azure functions, queues, and blob storage. (Note this app is currently stopped, but feel free to ask me about it.)
- [SqlChartify](https://sqlchartify.azurewebsites.net/) for writing queries and getting charts made with [ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/).

WinForms stuff:
- [ImgCloudPaste](https://github.com/adamfoneil/ImgCloudPaste), for pasting images and getting screenshot URLs using Azure storage
