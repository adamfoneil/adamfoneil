I'm into C#, SQL Server, and .NET Core. I love data access, Dapper, and I make a couple Dapper extension libraries:
- [Dapper.CX](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Dapper.CX), a CRUD library
- [Dapper.QX](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Dapper.QX), for making inline SQL better and testable
- [SqlServerUtil](https://github.com/adamfoneil/SqlServerUtil) bulk insert, deep copy, and view materializing utilities for SQL Server

If you need help with database design challenges, C# and Linq productivity with SQL Server, please reach out. I also work a lot with Azure:
- I love serverless code, and I create utilities for Azure Functions: [PayPalHelper](https://github.com/adamfoneil/PayPalHelper2), [CloudLicensing](https://github.com/adamfoneil/CloudLicensing). Much of my work in this area is closed source, but I can share my custom library [Excel2SqlServer](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Excel2SqlServer.Library) for importing Excel spreadsheets into SQL Server, which I use with Azure Functions.
- I love blob storage. Most of the stuff I do in this area is closed source, but I can share my homegrown continous deployment solution for WinForms apps [AzDeploy](https://github.com/adamfoneil/AzDeploy), which uses blob storage.
- I'm very familiar with Azure App Service, and have deployed and managed several web apps, notably [Ginseng8](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Ginseng8), although this project fizzled. I chase after lot of big ideas, many of which go nowhere. I'm very proud of [HistoricProperties.com](https://www.historicproperties.com/), an MVC app I did for my high school Latin teacher. This involved me hiring and collaborating with a front-end specialist who made this app look and behave well.
- I'm very familiar with Azure SQL Database, which grew out of my on-premises SQL Server background. I have a lot of experience with database design and performance troubleshooting.

I have some closed-source products:
- [SqlChartify](https://sqlchartify.azurewebsites.net/) for writing queries and getting charts made with [ChartJS](https://www.chartjs.org/).
- [ModelSync](http://www.aosoftware.net/modelSync.html), an EF migration alternative. (Subtext: I don't care for Entity Framework.)

When coworkers get stuck, I like to help with demo projects to sketch out possible solutions and to get the benefit of a clean slate:
- In [ChunkUpload](https://github.com/adamfoneil/ChunkUpload) for example, I sketched out an approach to supporting large file uploads
- In [NotifyDemo](https://github.com/adamfoneil/NotifyDemo) for example, I tried to implement a SignalR demo. But I get stuck too! I have no problem hiring people to help with unique problems, and to fill in gaps in my knowledge.

I work on many other odds and ends:
- I'm learning Blazor, and have a [demo project](https://github.com/adamfoneil/BlazorServerDemo) I'm working on intermittently. I really like what Blazor's about. (Subtext: I don't like JavaScript.)
- [RoslynMarkdowner](https://github.com/adamfoneil/RoslynMarkdowner), a utility for generating C# documentation
- [WinForms.Library](https://github.com/adamfoneil/WinForms.Library), data binding helpers for WinForms. I never made the transition to XAML/WPF, sorry
- [JsonSettings](https://github.com/adamfoneil/JsonSettings), for strong-typed json-based configuration, mainly in WinForms apps, with DPAPI encryption
- [ModelSync](https://github.com/adamfoneil/ModelSync), the library behind my ModelSync desktop app is open source
- [SqlServer.LocalDb](https://github.com/adamfoneil/SqlServer.LocalDb), an integration testing library for SQL Server
- [SourceFolderCleanup](https://github.com/adamfoneil/SourceFolderCleanup) another WinForms app I use personally
- [CredManager2](https://github.com/adamfoneil/CredManager2), a password manager I use myself, because it's fun to make stuff like this
